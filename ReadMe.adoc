= Drink Table  

An Amazon Alexa-enabled IoT device that mixes and pours drinks.  

Alexa treats this table as a dimmable light. A given brightness percentage represents a drink selection or a command for the table to execute.

== Step 1: Installation  

1. Download this repository.  
2. Create an Arduino IoT Cloud Thing.  
3. Create a cloud variable named `drinkSelection` and configure it as follows:  
   - Type: Dimmed Light  
   - Permissions: Read & Write  
   - Trigger: On Change  
4. Set up the associated device as an ESP32 and configure it with your Wi-Fi username and password.  
5. Copy the contents of `DrinkTable.ino` into your main Arduino file.  
6. Install the required libraries and resolve any variable name conflicts.  

== Step 2: Assemble the Circuit  

Assemble the circuit following the diagram in `ESP32Wiring.pdf`.  

== Step 3: Load the Code  

1. Upload the code from this sketch onto an ESP32 board.  
2. In the Alexa app:  
   - Add the Arduino IoT skill.  
   - Link your account.  
3. Have Alexa search for new devices and add the table controller.  
4. Set up routines to define what phrases correspond to specific drinks or actions.
